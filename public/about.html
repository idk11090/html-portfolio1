<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi. My name is Dilara. I am a 14 year old teen girl. I am from Egypt, born in Saudi Arabia and raised in Turkiye. I have 5 siblings. One 
  older and five younger sisters. I can speak English, Turkish and some Arabic. I'm also trying to learn Japanese. I usually
like to spend my time drawing, playing video games or 3D modelling. I also like watching anime, true crime documents and
ghost hunting videos.</p>

<p>I am learning web development because I am interested in programming and coding. I'm thinking of becoming a game 
  developer, grafic designer or an architect in the future. Though I'm still not sure which one to pick. </p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy my website, I'm still learning. Have a great day/night.</p>
